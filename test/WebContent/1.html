	<h2>HTML</h2>
	<P>
		Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
		creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets
		(CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for
		the World Wide Web.[4] Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web
		server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia
		web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
		originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML
		elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
		images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded
		into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
		documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
		paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are
		delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as 
		and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags
		such as
	<p>surround and provide information about document text and may
		include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML
		tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML can
		embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript,
		which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS
		defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium
		(W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has
		encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since
		1997.[5]
