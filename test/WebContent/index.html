	<h2>WEB</h2>
	<P>The World Wide Web (WWW), also called the Web, is an information
		space where documents and other web resources are identified by
		Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and
		accessible via the Internet.[1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee and
		Belgian informatics engineer Robert Cailliau invented the World Wide
		Web in 1989. They wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed
		at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The browser was released outside CERN in
		1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991
		and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991. The World
		Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age
		and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the
		Internet.[4][5][6] Web pages are primarily text documents formatted
		and annotated with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).[7] In addition to
		formatted text, web pages may contain images, video, audio, and
		software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as
		coherent pages of multimedia content. Embedded hyperlinks permit users
		to navigate between web pages. Multiple web pages with a common theme,
		a common domain name, or both, make up a website. Website content can
		largely be provided by the publisher, or interactively where users
		contribute content or the content depends upon the users or their
		actions. Websites may be mostly informative, primarily for
		entertainment, or largely for commercial, governmental, or
		non-governmental organisational purposes.
